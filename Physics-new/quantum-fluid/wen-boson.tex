\title{Bosonic Field Theories in Condensed Matter Physics}
\author{Jinyuan Wu}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

This article is a reading note of Wen's famous textbook \cite{Wen2007}. 
It is mainly a reconstruction of material related to the KT phase transition covered in Chapter~3 . 

\section{A simplest interacting boson system}

(3.3.1) in Section~3.3.1 provides a simplest interacting bosonic system with a complex scalar field \marginnote{Section~3.3.1}
\begin{equation}
    S = \int \dd[d]{\vb*{x}} \dd{t} (\ii \varphi^* \partial_t \varphi - \frac{1}{2m} \partial_{\vb*{x}} \varphi^* \partial_{\vb*{x}} \varphi + \mu \abs*{\varphi}^2 - \frac{V_0}{2} \abs*{\varphi}^4).
    \label{eq:bosonic}
\end{equation}
\marginnote{Eq. (3.3.1)}
The prefactor of the interaction term makes the corresponding term in the EOM of $\varphi$ and $\varphi^*$ not 
have a numerical factor, but it introduces a numerical factor in the vertex in Feynman diagrams. The sign of 
the mass term is derived as follows: first we have a $- \varphi^* \laplacian \varphi / 2m$ term in the 
Hamiltonian, and therefore we have a $\varphi^* \laplacian \varphi / 2m$ term in the Lagrangian, and by 
integration by parts we have $\varphi^* \laplacian \varphi / 2m \simeq - \partial_{\vb*{x}} \varphi^* 
\partial_{\vb*{x}} \varphi / 2m$. 

The semiclassical approximation from (3.3.1) to (3.3.2) can be justified when the temperature is high 
and therefore the most economical path does not have imaginary time evolution at all. It can also 
be derived using the ideas behind (3.4.1), where with a finite temperature, we can always integrate 
out modes with non-zero Matsubara frequencies. This gives a physical picture behind dynamic density 
functional theories and also explains why ``classical'' statistical physics is still relevant today.
It should be noted that when the temperature is low, parameters in the ``classical'' theory obtained 
by integrating out non-zero Matsubara frequencies are different with the truly classical approximation,
though they have exactly the same form. The fact can also be seen in the comparison between classical DFT 
and DFT in the context of hard condensed matter physics. 

This, actually, demonstrates the fact that the \emph{interpretation} of what ``quantum'' actually means 
is still confusing. In standard textbooks we learned that ``a quantum theory uses operators as basic 
degrees of freedom, while a classical theory do not'' and ``the Lagrangian of a quantum theory is to 
be placed into a partition function, while we just need to minimize the Lagrangian in a classical theory''.
But no one has ever \emph{seen} an operator or the quasi-probability distribution defined in path integral.
The idea to integrate out non-zero Matsubara frequencies to modify the parameters in the classical theory 
gives us a strange sense, that somehow the quantum effect is really just certain additional fluctuation
added to a classical theory. 

Note that we can only integrate out non-zero Matsubara frequencies when the temperature is not too low. 
When $T=0$, we need to integrate out \emph{uncountably} infinite degrees of freedom, 
which may have some subtlety. This gives rise to some uniquely zero-temperature quantum phenomena. 

The following contents from Eq.~(3.3.3) to Eq.~(3.3.4) are also covered in \oldfluid. \marginnote{Section~3.3.2}
The discussion between Eq. (3.3.4) to the end of Section~3.3.2 is important, which illustrates the 
Ginzburg-Landau paradigm and why it is almost always associated with symmetries (or otherwise it is 
highly unlikely that we have several minima of the energy functional that share the same energy, so 
that we have a smooth phase transition shown in Fig.~3.5), though the concept of order parameters 
can also be used in a first-order phase transition (see \href{../quasicrystal-fd/main.pdf}{here}, 
for example).  

\section{Quantum XY model from \eqref{eq:bosonic}}\label{sec:quantum-xy}

Note that there is no BEC when $\mu < 0$. \marginnote{Section~3.3.3} 
This is often justified by the argument that the 
Bose-Einstein distribution function is not well-defined when $\epsilon < \mu$, and if $\mu > 0$,
there must be a finite number of particles condensed on the ground state. The fact is also shown 
in the discussion around \eqref{oldfluid-eq:bec-ground} in \oldfluid.
The derivation of (3.3.10) is also done in \eqref{oldfluid-eq:quantum-xy} in \oldfluid, in the form 
of an imaginary time field theory. 

We call (3.3.10) a quantum \emph{XY} model. It is easy to see that its classical approximation is 
exactly the coarse-grained version of a classical XY model, and since $\theta$ is a real bosonic field,
the simplest way to give it time evolution (``quantum fluctuation'') is to add a $(\partial_t \theta)^2$
term. An interesting question may be how can we write down a quantum version of the \emph{lattice} XY 
model whose continuum field theory is (3.3.10). TODO: is this just \cite{latticemodel,Z_iga_2014}?

The method the author used to derive (3.3.13) and (3.3.14) is not really necessary in this case, 
since we all know what $\theta$ actually means, but it is a general method to connect the original 
degrees of freedom to the degrees of freedom in the effective theory so that we are able to calculate 
physical quantities defined in the original theory.

The quasiparticles corresponding to the $\theta$ field have linear dispersion. They are spin waves when 
the field $\varphi \sim S^x + \ii S^y$. In Section~\ref{oldfluid-sec:intro-superfluid} of \oldfluid,
we introduced a physical picture which says if there are ``phonons'' in a bosonic liquid (and in this case 
$\varphi$ is the field operator of the bosons forming the fluid), then there may be a superfluid phase.
Therefore, sometimes we also call the quasiparticles connected to $\theta$ \emph{phonons}.

\section{Superfluid as a toy universe}

\marginnote{Section 3.3.5}
If there are ``phonon charges'' in a superfluid, then we can always fix a test charge at one particular 
point, and a static electric field surrounds it. Note, however, that if we regard $\theta$ as the potential,
then the electric field $- \grad \theta$ is just the current of the $\varphi$ bosons. In a static $\grad{\theta}$
configuration, we have stale non-zero $\grad{\theta}$, meaning that $\varphi$ bosons continuously flow from 
the position of the test charge to infinity. This definitely is not allowed in 

Still I'm not sure about what a roton is in this picture \ldots

\section{KT phase transition}

The KT phase transition in the \emph{classical} XY model - which is most frequently 
seen in introduction to KT phase transition itself - is covered in \ktnote. It should be noticed that the 
phase transition is not restricted to the classical region - we may define quantum XY models, just as
is the case in \prettyref{sec:quantum-xy}. 

TODO: For example, the $\theta$ degrees of freedom in \ktnote{} can be realized with quantum rotors, which are 
introduced in the first chapter in \cite{Sachdev2009}. 

However, since the KT phase transition is a ,
