% In Statistical Physics: Theory of the Condensed State by E. M. Lifshitz, L. P. Pitaevskii,
% the authors argued that the first sound (i.e. ordinary sound wave) in Fermi liquid is associated
% with thermal equilibration. This may rise some concern over whether the first sound can be 
% quantized as a zero temperature quantum excitation. This is also siginificant in the general theory 
% of statistical physics, because if the answer is "not", then we have found something that is truly
% energy converving, etc. yet cannot be quantized.
