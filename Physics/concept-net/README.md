This folder contains Markdown files created with Typora that form a concept network in physics.

The `physics` macro package is used; to enable the package, see [here](https://github.com/typora/typora-issues/issues/3856).

The main reason to use Markdown instead of LaTeX is to enable hyperlink between files.
